## Name
Challenge 3: Password Generator 

## Description
This allows you to select if you wanna use uppercase, lowercase, number, and special characters, to create a password of your desired length


## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.


## Usage
use this generator to create a random mix of variables for a password
